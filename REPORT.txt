Report: PDF Data Extraction

Approach:
1. Downloaded the Kaggle "resume dataset" and extracted the necessary files by creating api comand used google collaboratory.
2. Installed the PyPDF2 library in Python to extract data from PDF files.
3. Created a Python script to iterate through each PDF file in the dataset and extract the required details.
4. Used PyPDF2 functions to extract the category, skills, and education details from each CV.
5. Stored the extracted details in a structured format for further analysis.

Challenges faced and solutions:
1. Challenge: Different PDF formats and layouts in the dataset made it difficult to extract data consistently.
   Solution: Implemented a flexible approach by analyzing the structure of each PDF file and adapting the extraction process accordingly.

2. Challenge: Some CVs had missing or incomplete information, making it challenging to extract all the required details.
   Solution: Implemented error handling mechanisms to handle missing data and ensure the extraction process continued smoothly.

3. challenge: Some of the things like job descriptions were new to me and also using cosine similarity to match.
   Solutions: Used some of the resources how to do it and read some websites like geeks for geeks and stackOverflow and able to perform the given task

   - Candidate 5: Similarity Score - 0.78

Recommendations or insights from the matching process:
1. The PDF data extraction process was successful in extracting the required details from the CVs in the dataset.
2. The matching process using similarity scores provided a ranking of candidates based on their relevance to the job descriptions.
3. Further analysis can be done by considering additional factors such as experience, location, and certifications to improve the matching process.
4. The use of BERT or DistilBERT for embedding extraction can enhance the accuracy of the matching process by capturing semantic similarities between CVs and job descriptions.
5. Regular updates to the job description dataset and continuous improvement of the PDF extraction process will ensure accurate and up-to-date matching results.
